# Work Day Scheduler


### Description

This daily planner application allows users to create and manage their daily schedules. Users can view the current day at the top of the calendar, scroll through time blocks for standard business hours, and enter events for specific time slots. The application color-codes each time block to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future relative to the current time. Users can save their events, and the saved events persist even after refreshing the page, thanks to local storage.

### Features
